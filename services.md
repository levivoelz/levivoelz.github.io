I mostly write code for mobile apps, web apps, and websites but I can also do preliminary UX and UI design, write specs and documentation, and fix your email (if I’m not busy and you are nice to me). I’ve also helped tutor a few people on programming.

**FAQ’s**

_How much does a website/app cost?_<br />
As much as you want to spend, but you can get a decent website for like $50 on Squarespace. I’ve built apps for as little as $10k.

_What’s your hourly rate?_<br />
I work with an agency and the average project gets billed at $175/hr through them. I get a percentage of that.

_Will you work on-site?_<br />
Maybe. Where are you located? If you’re in the Bay Area then probably. If not, it's possible but not likely.

_What’s your alma mater?_<br />
I don’t know what that means.

_Do you know XYZ tech?_<br />
Is it PHP? ‘Cause if it’s PHP the answer is no.

_Should I use Wordpress for my website?_<br />
Probably not.

_Will you take equity for a lower rate?_<br />
Probably not but I’ll hear your pitch.

_Can you help me with my email?_<br />
Uh…
