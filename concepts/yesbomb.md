    <h1>Yesbomb.com</h1>
    <p>An idea dissemination and feedback platform</p>
    <p>It's either a hell yes or a hell no</p>
    <p>I send out a link to my homies that only works once. After the initial click, the link expires and you can never use it again. They go through this form and qualify to check out my ideas.</p>
    <p>If they've been here before, no need to go throught the heavy vetting process. Start where asking them if they have the same problem as me.</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Use your time wisely and read everything carefully.</p>
    <h2>Will you sign an NDA?</h2>
    <input type='radio' name='zero' id='zero-yes' value='yes'>
    <label for='zero-yes'>Yes (go to ID)</label>
    <input type='radio' name='zero' id='zero-no' value='no'>
    <label for='zero-no'>no (abort and sad face)</label>
    <h2>First thing's first, let's verify your identity.</h2>
    <p>Is it really you? Let's see your ID. (verified, go NDA. otherwise, eat a fat one.)</p>
    <input type='file' name='id' id='id' />
    <h2>NDA</h2>
    <p>You will never speak of this to anyone besides those named in this agreement, etc. Agreed?</p>

    <input type='radio' name='speak' id='speak-no' value='no'>
    <label for='speak-no'>no (abort and middle finger and never contact again)</label>
    <h2>Let's get down to business. Do you have the same problem as me?</h2>
