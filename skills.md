I prefer to work on a team, have/make clear project specs, create automated tests, code in Ruby, work on the the UI first, and join projects early in the design or development process.

I primarily write code in Ruby and JavaScript but sometimes in Go.

I like React and React Native—a lot. I’m also a “Rails guy” and I’m not ashamed to say it. Ok, maybe a little, but seriously? Why the bad rap? I can build a simple production ready app in Ruby on Rails in a day. What?

I’m down with static types. Just don’t get all dogmatic with me about it. Flexibility is good too.

Some developers don’t like Clean Code. Dirty hippies.

I’m a luddite IRL. _Probably not surprising._

Please don’t use “The Cloud” in your marketing copy.

Once, I wasn’t able to write a fib sequence during a code interview in under 3 minutes.

Why doesn’t the “tech” industry do stages like fine dining restaurants do?

There are too many testing libraries and not enough tests.

Don’t ask me to fix your email.

_What is this page about?_ Oh yeah! Here's a [list](/skills-list) of all the **tech skills** I have that I can think of.
