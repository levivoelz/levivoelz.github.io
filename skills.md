I prefer to work with other people, have/make clear project specs, create automated tests, code in Ruby, build the UI first, and work on projects early in the design or development process.

I primarily write code in Ruby and JavaScript but sometimes in Go, C/C++, and Java. NS prefixes bother me but I’ll get over it.

I like React and React Native—a lot. I’m also a “Rails guy” and I’m not ashamed to say it. Ok, maybe a little, but seriously? Why the bad rap? I can build a simple production ready app in Ruby on Rails in a day. What man?

I’m down with static types. Just don’t get all dogmatic with me about it.

I think a lot about image processing, authentication and authorization, webRTC, and computer vision. Don’t ask why.

I try not to think about recursion. I find that I’m happier that way.

Some developers don’t like Clean Code. Dirty hippies.

I’m a luddite IRL.

Please don’t use “The Cloud” in your marketing copy.

At one point I wasn’t able to write a fib sequence function during a code interview in under 3 minutes. I’m sure that’s not the case now…

Why doesn’t the “tech” industry do stages like fine dining restaurants do?

There are too many testing libraries and not enough tests.

Building applications is more fun than writing open source.

Don’t ask me to fix your email.
