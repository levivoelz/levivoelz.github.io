I write Ruby, JavaScript, and Go for mobile apps and web apps. I do some preliminary UX design for very early stage projects and I write specs and documentation.

Here's where I'm a badass:
- Server-side and client-side Architecture and planning
- Development in Ruby, Go and Node.js.
  - REST API development
  - Relational data modeling and serialization
  - Third-party integrations using raw services or SDK's
  - Real-time communication (RTC) services
  - Distributed and monolithic architecture
- Development using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, and React Native
  - Middleware and library development
  - Offline application development
  - Background processessing and other browser leveraging strategies
  - RTC clients
  - Eager and lazy data syncing strategies
  - Cross-browser compatibility issues debugging
- Preliminary UX design and wireframes
- Rapid prototyping, no code apps using Zapier, AirTable, Sheets, etc

Don't ask me where I'm not a badass.

### FAQâ€™s

_How much does an app cost?_<br />
Most land in the $30-50k range. The sky is the limit, though. We spent over $500k developing [Upshot](https://upshotstories.com){:target="_blank"}. ðŸ˜®

_Whatâ€™s your hourly rate?_<br />
I'm flexible, so [let's chat](/contact) and figure it out.

_Will you work on-site?_<br />
Maybe. Where are you located? If youâ€™re in the Bay Area then probably. If not, it's possible but not likely.

_What development technologies to you work with?_<br />
Mostly Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, React Native, PostgreSQL, Nginx, and Go. I've worked with others like Java, PHP, Python, MySQL, Apache, jQuery, and Backbone.js, but the former are ones I like the most. I'm always trying new things, so this list might be outdated by the time you read it.

_Whatâ€™s your alma mater?_<br />
I donâ€™t know what that means.

_Do you know XYZ tech?_<br />
Is it PHP? â€˜Cause if itâ€™s PHP the answer is no.

Probably not, but there are certain circumstances where it makes sense.

_Will you take equity for a lower rate?_<br />
Probably not, but Iâ€™ll hear your pitch!

Uhâ€¦
