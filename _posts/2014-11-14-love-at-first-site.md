title: Love at First Site
---

I built my first website nearly 12 years ago in 2003. Working at a restaurant in Sedona, AZ, I didn't have very much money, was living at home with my folks, and didn't really know what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, except make music. I got a Macbook Pro, with the help of my Mom, and was using it to write really awful house music in their garage. 

At the time, my Dad was starting a new company that would provide high quality produce for the world and had a business plan with a really bad graphic of a greenhouse and a bunch of tomatoes hovering over it. I asked him if I could try and make a new graphic using a this really fancy software called Photoshop that could make anything look great. I don't remember the exact details of how it went down, but I think I read some tutorials online and figured out how to create layers, select the image, etc. I ended up making pretty much the same graphic, except in prettier layers with a bleed.

I was enamored with my new machine and figuring I could do anything with it. The possibilities were endless. As a teenager, I lived at a boys ranch and there was a kid there who I considered a hacker. He had a computer stuffed away in a storage building that he had connected to the Internet via a high jacked phone line and would be on an IRC channel nearly every night. I figured he was hacking into NASA or something, but really he was just chatting with friends. I would hang out, play guitar and watch him on the computer for hours wondering what the hell he was up to.

Photoshop was just the beginning. I wanted to learn how to hack and scoured the web looking for a way to get into it. Some people said, "Learn Python". I worked for at it for weeks(yes weeks), and didn't get very far. I needed something more "beginner"â€”HTML. That was it.

My girlfriend's Mom was a small business owner and we were really close. I'd come over to her house and cook dinner for everyone and we'd chat about things. She knew I made music and that I was really into my computer. I told her I was learning how to program and she asked me if I knew how to build a website. Of course I did. At the bookstore, I found like three or four books on HTML, web design, and Photoshop. I was going to be a web designer.

There's only a little part of the [old website](http://www.sedonaofficerentals.com/sedona-mini-storage-facilities.html) that's still up. I took a photo of their facility and did my magic in Photoshop. We used that brilliant graphic in the site header, which is still there. The bluffs in the background aren't really visible from the property. And, I made them look like they were super close.

I considered this project successfull and continued to built shitty websites for several years. It wasn't untill about 2005/6 that I really felt like I was getting the hang of it. Poor bastards.

###Project Rundown

####Brief
I used my handy dandy web design how to book to figure what I needed to ask my "client" and came up with a "creative brief". I didn't know what the heck I was doing, but, fuck it, there was $500 on the table, and I was going to be professional.

####Comp
After practicing a few graphics on my Dad's business plan, my graphic design skills were perfectly honed. I created a spectacular layout utilizing the colors of Sedona's Red Rocks, big extra-embossed buttons, and a really small font size.
	
####Code
Photoshop 7 was amazing at taking a comp and turning it into a "website". `<tables>` and all. I remember having to muscle around the complex JavaScript in order to get the rollovers to work right. It all looked like Russian or something to me. I did it, and that was all that mattered. I could brag to my friends that I could write code.

####Handoff
She was really pleased with the site. It took a few weeks longer than I expected it would, but I did it and I was proud.
