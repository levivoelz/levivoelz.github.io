Do you have a side project or are considering one? If so, you don't need to use Figma to flush out your ideas, however, you should have some sort of a design before coding. With a pencil, paper, UI library, and a little imagination you can go from concept to completed project faster than two shakes of a lambs tail.

To illustrate, I'll use a real feature from a project I'm working on. 

**Problem**

I run a beta program for my side project and am having trouble converting signups to installs. Currently, users have to wait until I get around to inviting them before they can install. At that point, most don't follow through.

**Solution**

Give visitors the option to immediately install the app after joining.

**Requirements**

- After signing up, ask if they want the app now
- If they do
  - Ask them to fill out a quick survey
  - Get OS info
  - Accept beta terms
  - Show install link
- If they don't want to do all that
  - Let them know I'll reach out during the next batch

I have the requirements, so now I can start designing. Because I have a UI library in my back pocket, I can focus on UX.

**Existing UI**

Currently, not much happens after they click "Sign up". They just see a toast that basically says, "Talk soon!"

The new flow gets triggered once they click "Sign up".

**Sketches**

They key with sketches is to flush out the rough idea. Some tweaks will inevitably be made and details will need to be filled in once coding begins.

**Finished feature**

There are some slight deviations from the sketch. Overall, it follows pretty close. To try it out, go to [https://derivv.com](https://derivv.com).
