<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>The Problem</b></span></div>
<div><i>So much music—so much difficulty finding good music.</i></div>
<div>Inexpensive recording equipment and synthesized instrumentation have reduced the barrier to entry in the music industry. Anyone can create and publish music these days, and it seems like everyone is, which makes it harder and harder to find good new music outside of established channels. There are billions of tracks out there and most of them have hardly been listened to before. There’s plenty of music on the web, so how do you find the good stuff? And, more importantly, how do great artists separate themselves from ordinary artists so others can see their value? Aside from getting signed to a record label and going down the traditional, yet antiquated path, there aren't many options.</div>
<hr>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>The Solution</b></span></div>
<div><i>Curate all recorded music on the web.</i></div>
<div>By analyzing, categorizing, and tagging every track from SoundCloud, YouTube, and other sites using the GoodMus web application, we can easily curate playlists and radio stations with only the very best raw music we find. Finally, music fans will be able to listen to talented musicians they’ve never heard before and connect with them before they’ve either been picked up by a label, or worse yet, they've given up. This allows artists to sidestep traditional industry methods for content delivery and get on the fast-track to making a living doing what they love.</div>
<hr>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>How</b></span></div>
<div><i>Let users do the heavy lifting.</i></div>
<div>Pandora has been successful at categorizing music with their Music Genome Project®, which entails musicologists carefully listening to a track, tagging it with a variety of attributes, and adding it to their ever-growing database. They fall short in two ways:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Only analyzing officially published tracks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Only allowing <i>their</i> musicologists to analyze tracks.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We intend not only to have qualified musicologists analyze tracks, but also allow fans to qualify as a musicologist and analyze tracks themselves. Through a process of carefully listening to tracks and tagging them with attributes such as genre, sub-genre, instrumentation, vocal style, influences, etc, they will learn about every element that makes up a song and discover a new way of listening. Once they understand the fundamentals, they'll become officially qualified to add tracks to our database. They get to keep their discoveries on their profile and show off their superior tastes, which makes for an engaging and exciting experience.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Once we’ve built a large enough database of tracks we can have our taste makers and musicologists create a wide range of playlists, and let our algorithms create radio stations packed with good music from all genres, sub-genres, and every niche imaginable for the rest of the world to consume. People will be able to find the exact type of music they are wanting for any occasion or mood and discover great new artists from any place on Earth.</div>
<hr>
<div style="text-align: center"><i><span style="font-size: 18px;">GoodMus is the best place on the planet to find good music by undiscovered artists.</span></i></div>
<hr>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Who</b></span></div>
<div><i>Fans</i></div>
<div>Our primary target audience are teenagers, young adults, and die-hard enthusiasts of any age. These adventurers love to be the first to find something new. They are already out listening to songs, keeping track of them, and sharing with their friends. But, they don’t have a great place to keep track of their discoveries and show off what they’ve found. By creating a fun and exciting experience for them through our platform we’ll keep them interested and coming back for more.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><i>Artists</i></div>
<div>Artists will benefit from this platform tremendously. I started this project primarily to help them. Any leg up for an artist is huge. Separating the wheat from the chaff will encourage great artists to bring their best music to the world and inspire people others to move. There are plenty of niches for artists that are waiting to be filled and GoodMus is the platform to do it.</div>
<hr>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>The Model</b></span></div>
<div><i>Win-Win</i></div>
<div>By curating playlists and creating radio stations, we'll create a lot of value for listeners. Once we have enough channels put together we can sell advertising on our stations and playlists, and sell premium subscriptions for ad-free listening. Artists get paid based on number of plays and we’ll take a percentage off the top. By cutting out the middle-man (record labels, producers, publishers, and distributors), we'll have lower overhead than traditional delivery platforms and can pay artists a larger share than they would normally get.</div>
<hr>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>The Future</b></span></div>
<div><i>Additional channels</i></div>
<div>Down the road, we'll invite hand-picked artists to play gigs and host small and large concerts in every city and every neighborhood all around the world. Fans will contribute to events and support their favorite artists at will. There’s no pressure and no limits. We'll take a percentage out of every transaction and keep everything from food and beverage sales. The rest goes to the artists.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><i>Let robots give us a hand.</i></div>
<div>By investing heavily in development of innotvative machine learning and sound analysis algorithms, our application can pre-screen and identify music for our musicologists that is unique, in key, on tempo, and conveys emotion. While this will never compensate for the human ear, it will help our users save time and resources weeding through poorly composed music, non-music material, and copyrighted songs. In the future, more and more artists will be creating music and the world deserves feel their joy, pain, and love they express—helping us become more connected and in tune with each other.</div>
