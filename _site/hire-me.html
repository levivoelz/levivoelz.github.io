<p>That’s a really good question and I wanted to clear that up. There are a lot of developers out there. There are more affordable ones, there are faster ones, there are more technically capable ones, and there are more specialized ones. I’m a generalist, which some people like to poopoo. However, you are not them. You are a bit of a generalist yourself. You know marketing, sales, operations and maybe design. You have big ideas and want to test them out. You need someone who can wear many hats and get the job done, just like you.</p>

<p>You need someone who can communicate clearly and get along great with engineers, designers, managers, and executives. You need someone who can jump into a project and quickly grasp your goals. You need someone who gives a shit about making awesome products and wants to be there. You need someone who understands how marketing works and is interested in building products with growth in mind. You need someone who plans, organizes and delegates.</p>

<p>Besides being able to build great apps, I can do all of those things you need. If you are working on a new product or feature and need someone to jump in on your project and ensure it gets done, I’m your guy. If you need someone to build your prototype so you can pitch your concept to investors or test it out with your target market, I’m your guy. If you need someone to design a system that you can bring to market and scale up quickly, I’m your guy. If you need a developer to jump in and build a wrapper library for your REST API, I’m your guy.</p>

<p>While we’re at it, we should be clear about what I’m not a good hire for you. I’m not going to be very good at helping you tune your machine learning models. I’m not interested in squeezing the last little bit of performance out of your database or sharding it. I’m not interested in writing your entire app in Vanilla JS because someone said it was a good idea.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you should hire me because I give a shit, I’ll figure it out, and I’ll be your partner while doing it. We’ll do amazing things and I look forward to working with you.</p>
