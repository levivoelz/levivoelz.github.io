        <p><strong>Based in Sonoma County, CA, born in Red Lodge, MT, Levi is a self-taught software engineer, maker, artist, and inventor.</strong></p>

<p>After a troubled childhood and early adulthood, he took an interest in programming as a way to learn a valuable skill without a significant monetary investment by using the web as his tutor.</p>

<p>He assumed that with little experience and no college degree, it would be difficult to find a programming job. At the time it was easy to find small business owners wanting a website and building sites for them allowed him to earn an income while studying software engineering, computer science, and mathematics at home.</p>

<p>Interested in music at an early age, he started DJ’ing in his mid-teens and played Drum and Bass, Breaks, and House music at large parties and festivals. Later on, he was a regular DJ at nightclubs such as Bar Standard and The Church in Denver, CO. His passion for music has always been present and he has written numerous electronic music tracks over the years.</p>

<p>Levi describes himself as perpetually curious and inventive. When he was 3 he took apart his mother’s vacuum to see what was inside. When he was 7, he designed an integrated ski boot with short skis and an internal pump, like Rebok Pumps. Although he felt his ideas weren’t taken seriously or nurtured as a child, he continued to dream, draw, and build. His inventiveness and creativity are apparent in his work, for both his personal and professional projects.</p>

<p>Levi continues to dream and invent along with his two young girls and wife in Sonoma County. Along with his work he enjoys designing and building projects for his family’s home.</p>

<!-- Once described as "just a numb-headed UI guy", I'll admit I'm not very smart. After a rough patch in my teens and early twenties, I decided to learn how to program so I could get some sweet brain creds. I learned a little bit, built a few things, and in 2003 I got a gig making a website for a storage unit company in Sedona, AZ. The owner's daughter was my girlfriend at the time and that's probably how I got the job.

After building a few websites for friends and family, I teamed up with a guy I met at a dive bar and we started our own web design company, Submuse Design Studio. At Submuse we spent most of our time developing our marketing materials, and less on serving clients. Mysteriously, it didn't pan out for us. Still thinking about that one.

I started a few other projects (startups?) with friends because legit companies wouldn't hire me. We built some pretty cool stuff like an interactive video e-commerce platform, an [ai meeting note-taker app/bot/thing](/projects/jetson), and a crowd-sourced music curation and distribution platform. I did end up getting a real-deal engineering job at a startup based out of Toronto but got laid off about 6 months into it. I was on an R&D-ish team, which I've heard is usually the first lot to get cut in a downturn. They hired me back as a freelancer a few months later to help maintain the app we built, so I guess it worked out in the end.

A little over 20 years after I started on that storage unit site, and I'm still making websites. I deviated slightly to mobile development for a couple of years but it didn't bring me joy. I might've moved on to something else entirely, like gardening, but I haven't figured out how to make money at that.

While I specialize in web UI, I'm also considered full-stack (Node/Ruby/Go). Most full-stackers are back-end-leaning, which is smart. I never really enjoyed backend engineering. I like pictures and buttons and stuff.

People say I'm good at what I do and that they are surprised I haven't made it further in life. They say things like, "Man, I figured you'd be like mega-rich by now." I usually don't have a response for that so I just laugh. A lot of rich people aren't very smart either so maybe I'll redeem myself in the eyes of my peers someday. -->
