        <p><em>TL;DR -&gt; I’m a software|web developer/programmer, app maker and UX designer.</em></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Like a lot of folks, I started by building websites ages ago using Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I didn’t go to school for design or engineering and honestly didn’t think I’d be doing it for this long. I fell into project after project because people needed help with their websites and I was sorta good at it.</p>

<p>At some point I decided to take things more seriously and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to get work in the tech industry. My first job out here was at a backup and recovery company called eVault (acquired by Seagate and then Carbonite) as the website manager. I worked on the website a little bit but spent most of my time in meetings. I really liked being hands-on and making things (still do), so it wasn’t exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I had pretty decent design skills and ok programming skills but was conflicted about choosing one or the other discipline as a career. Ultimately, I chose programming because I wanted to learn more about how computers work, which led to an entry level programming job at <a href="https://www.walmartlabs.com/" target="_blank">WalmartLabs</a>. That’s where I really started to understand what I could do with computers and loved every minute of it.</p>

<p>While at Walmart, I had my core responsibilities, building HTML/CSS/JS modules for walmart.com, which were mostly fancy banner ads. In my spare time I carved out a niche for myself building apps for other devs on our team, the creative department, and site merchandising department. It was a lot of fun. After a while I didn’t need to build modules for the website because I built an app that let merchants build their own modules without having to write code. I also built another cool app that helped speed up the <a href="https://derivv.com" target="_blank">image resizing</a> process for product images. That app saved billions of dollars*.</p>

<p>After being there for a couple years, I decided to get a job at smaller company so I could focus entirely on app development. I landed a job as a “software craftsman”–a fitting title, with a biz called Influitive. Because of my entrepreneurial background I got to work on the Moonshots team, which was like a little startup inside the main company. The five of us conceptualized, designed, and built a new content creation and distribution plaform called <a href="https://upshotstories.com" target="_blank">Upshot Stories</a>. You can check it out the landing page and read some stories but it’ll cost you some serious $$$ to actually see the app. Sadly, our team was ununceremoniously disbanded shortly after launching, but it’s steadily grown since then with very little resources.</p>

<p>For the past few years I’ve been working remotely as a freelance developer in Sonoma County, California. I’ve been a maintainer, pinch hitter, architect, and project lead. I’ve designed a few things and built many things. I even fix people’s email every once in a while(when they buy me a coffee).</p>
