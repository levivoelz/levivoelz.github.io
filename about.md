I’m a programmer, designer, and maker. I like taking things apart to figure out how they work and designing and building all sorts of things from highly interactive web apps to static objects like furniture. Basically, I’m part problem identifier and part problem solver with a sprinkle of artist on top. I also write electronic music from time to time.
