I’m a programmer, designer, and maker. I take things apart to figure out how they work and I design and build all sorts of things from highly interactive web apps to static objects like furniture. Basically, I’m part problem identifier and part problem solver with a sprinkle of artist on top. I also write electronic music from time to time.
