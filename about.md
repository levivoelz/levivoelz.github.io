_TL;DR -> I'm a software\|web developer/programmer, app maker and UX designer._

**Background**

Like a lot of folks, I started by building websites ages ago using Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I didn’t go to school for design or engineering and honestly didn’t think I’d be doing it for this long. I fell into project after project because people needed help with their websites and I was sorta good at it.

At some point I decided to take things more seriously and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to get work in the tech industry. My first job out here was at a backup and recovery company called eVault (acquired by Seagate and then Carbonite) as the website manager. I worked on the website a little bit but spent most of my time in meetings. I really liked being hands-on and making things (still do), so it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

I had pretty decent design skills and ok programming skills but was conflicted about choosing one or the other discipline as a career. Ultimately, I chose programming because I wanted to learn more about how computers work, which led to an entry level programming job at [WalmartLabs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/){:target="_blank"}. That’s where I really started to understand what I could do with computers and loved every minute of it.

While at Walmart, I had my core responsibilities, building HTML/CSS/JS modules for walmart.com, which were mostly fancy banner ads. In my spare time I carved out a niche for myself building apps for other devs on our team, the creative department, and site merchandising department. It was a lot of fun. After a while I didn’t need to build modules for the website because I built an app that let merchants build their own modules without having to write code. I also built another cool app that helped speed up the [image resizing](https://derivv.com){:target="_blank"} process for product images. That app saved billions of dollars*.

After being there for a couple years, I decided to get a job at smaller company so I could focus entirely on app development. I landed a job as a “software craftsman”–a fitting title, with a biz called Influitive. Because of my entrepreneurial background I got to work on the Moonshots team, which was like a little startup inside the main company. The five of us conceptualized, designed, and built a new content creation and distribution plaform called [Upshot Stories](https://upshotstories.com){:target="_blank"}. You can check it out the landing page and read some stories but it’ll cost you some serious $$$ to actually see the app. Sadly, our team was ununceremoniously disbanded shortly after launching, but it's steadily grown since then with very little resources.

For the past few years I’ve been working remotely as a freelance developer in Sonoma County, California. I’ve been a maintainer, pinch hitter, architect, and project lead. I’ve designed a few things and built many things. I even fix people's email every once in a while(when they buy me a coffee).
