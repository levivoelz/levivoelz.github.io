**Background**

Like a lot of web developers, I started by building websites for friends eons ago using Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I didn’t go to school for design or engineering and honestly didn’t think I’d be doing it for this long. I fell into project after project because people needed help with their websites and I was sorta good at it.

At some point I decided to take things more seriously and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to get work in the tech industry. My first job out here was at a backup and recovery company called eVault (acquired by Seagate) as the website manager. I worked on the website a little bit but spent most of my time in meetings. Not exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

I had pretty decent design skills and ok programming skills but was conflicted about choosing one or the other discipline as a career. Ultimately, I chose programming because I wanted to learn more about how computers work which led to an entry level programming job at Walmart eCommerce. That’s where I really started to understand what I could do with computers and loved every minute of it.

While at Walmart, I had my core responsibilities, building HTML/CSS/JS modules for walmart.com, which were mostly fancy banner ads. In my spare time I carved out a niche for myself building apps for our team, the creative department, and site merchandising department. It was a lot of fun. After a while I didn’t need to build modules for the website because I built an app that let merchants build their own modules without having to write code. I also built another cool app that helped speed up the image resizing process for product images. That app saved billions of dollars*.

After being there for a couple years, I decided to get a job at smaller company so I could work focus on app development. I landed a job as a “software craftsman”, which I thought was a fitting title, with a company called Influitive. Because of my entrepreneurial background I got to work on the Moonshots team, which was like a little startup inside the main company. The five of us conceptualized, designed, and built a new product, which I hear has steadily grown over the past few years with very little resources. It’s called Upshot Stories. You can check it out but it’ll cost you a few $k to get going.

For the past few years I’ve been working as a freelance developer in Sonoma County, California. I’ve been a maintainer, pinch hitter, architect, and project lead. I’ve designed a few things and built many things. I even fix people's email every once in a while when they buy me a coffee.
