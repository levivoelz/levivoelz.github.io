**Based in Sonoma County, California, Levi is a self-taught software engineer, maker, artist, and inventor.**

After a troubled childhood and shaky early adulthood, he took an interest in design and programming when he got his first PowerBook to make electronic music. He'd been DJaying at a nightclub in Sedona, AZ and a fellow DJ was making websites on the side as a way to suppliment his income. His friend taught him how to find clients, submit bids and write contracts.

After years of designing and building e-commerce sites, content management systems, and brochure-style websites for clients, Levi moved to San Francisco and worked at several companies as a software engineer. Later, he returned to independence and is now living in Sonoma County working as a freelance engineer and consultant for various industries like healthcare, renewable energy, and cybersecurity.

Levi primarily specializes in UI development for the web, but also mobile, mixed reality, and embedded systems.
