_**TL;DR** -> I build web and mobile applications and I care about great design—visual and functional, and great user experience._

### What I do
In a nutshell, I design, build, and maintain web and mobile applications. I design in a couple ways and at what level really depends on the stage at which I join a project. If I'm in at the conceptual phase, I contribute with feedback and sometimes [wireframes](/images/patronish-wires.png){:target="_blank"}. Most of the time, I land during the development phase, once design is complete and it's time to create the application architecture. I specialize in building JSON REST APIs and have come up with a great [formula]() for getting projects off the ground quickly. Since I'm usually working alone or on small teams, I tend to lean heavily on frameworks, libraries, and third-party services. This doesn't mean I won't "roll my own" when needed, but my formula generally works really well for most projects. For more info, check out my full list of [services](/services).

### Background

Like a lot of developers, I started by designing and building websites ages ago using Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I didn’t go to school for design or engineering and honestly didn’t think I’d be doing it for very long. I fell into project after project because people needed help with their websites and I was kind of good at it.

My niche in the web design industry was that I designed and programmed everything from scratch when a lot of other people were using templates. Initially, I built static HTML sites with minimal CSS and JS, and slowly learned how to build my own templates using Wordpress and PHP. I learned things as needed, meaning if a client wanted something, I usually said yes and learned how to do it. I learned complex interactions, styling, form submissions, and how to build plugins.

The more I learned, the more people wanted to me to do radical things. For example, I learned how to write ActionScript and use Flash just to build an interactive video player where people could purchase product placements.

In early 2012 I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and got work in the tech industry. My first job in SF was at a backup and recovery company called eVault (acquired by Seagate and then Carbonite) as the website manager (i.e. webmaster). I worked on the website a little bit but spent most of my time in meetings planning projects and negotiating with other team leads. I really missed being hands-on and making things. Even though I really liked my teammates, I didn't enjoy the work.

I had pretty decent design skills and ok programming skills, but was conflicted about choosing a discipline going forward. Ultimately, I chose programming because I wanted to learn more about how computers work, which led to an entry level programming job at [WalmartLabs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/){:target="_blank"}. That’s where things really started to come together for me.

While at Walmart, I had my core responsibilities, building HTML/CSS/JS modules for walmart.com, which were mostly fancy banner ads and carousels. In my spare time I carved out a niche building apps for the creative, site merchandising, and marketing departments. It was a lot of fun and a challenge. It was like running a little business inside Walmart. After a while I didn’t need to build modules for the website because I built an app that let merchants build their own modules without having to write code. I also built another cool app that helped speed up the [image resizing](https://derivv.com){:target="_blank"} process for product images. That app saved billions of dollars*.

After being there for a couple years, I decided to get a job at smaller company so I could focus entirely on app development and hone my skills by learning from more experienced developers. I landed a job as a “Software Craftsman”–a fitting title, with a company out of Toronto called Influitive. They had a satellite office in SF and because of my entrepreneurial-ish background I got to work on the Moonshots team, which was like a little startup inside the main company. The five of us conceptualized, designed, and built a new content creation and distribution plaform called [Upshot Stories](https://upshotstories.com){:target="_blank"}. You can check it out the landing page and read some stories but it’ll cost you some serious $$$ to actually see the app. Sadly, our team was ununceremoniously disbanded shortly after launching, however I was hired back on as a contractor to help with ongoing feature development and maintainence.

For the past few years I’ve been working semi-remotely as a freelance developer in Sonoma County, California, Petaluma, and San Francisco. I’ve been a maintainer, pinch hitter, architect, and project lead. I’ve designed a few things and built many things. I even fix people's email every once in a while(if they buy me a coffee).
