I’m a programmer, designer, and maker. I like taking things apart to figure out how they work and designing and building all sorts of stuff from highly interactive web apps to static objects like furniture. Basically, I’m part problem identifier and part problem solver with a sprinkle of artist on top.

_If you have ideas you are wanting to explore or collaborate on, hit me up. I'd love to chat._
