_TL;DR -> I'm a software\|web developer/programmer, app maker and UX designer._

**Background**

Like a lot of folks, I started by building websites ages ago using Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I didn’t go to school for design or engineering and honestly didn’t think I’d be doing it for very long. I fell into project after project because people needed help with their websites and I was kind of good at it.

In early 2012 I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and got work in the tech industry. My first job in SF was at a backup and recovery company called eVault (acquired by Seagate and then Carbonite) as the website manager. I worked on the website a little bit but spent most of my time in meetings planning projects and negotiating with other team leads. I really missed being hands-on and making things (still do). Even though I really liked my teammates, I didn't enjoy the work.

I had pretty decent design skills and ok programming skills, but was conflicted about choosing a discipline going forward. Ultimately, I chose programming because I wanted to learn more about how computers work, which led to an entry level programming job at [WalmartLabs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/){:target="_blank"}. That’s where things really started to come together for me.

While at Walmart, I had my core responsibilities, building HTML/CSS/JS modules for walmart.com, which were mostly fancy banner ads and carousels. In my spare time I carved out a niche building apps for the creative, site merchandising, and marketing departments. It was a lot of fun and a challenge. It was like running a little business inside Walmart. After a while I didn’t need to build modules for the website because I built an app that let merchants build their own modules without having to write code. I also built another cool app that helped speed up the [image resizing](https://derivv.com){:target="_blank"} process for product images. That app saved billions of dollars*.

After being there for a couple years, I decided to get a job at smaller company so I could focus entirely on app development and hone my skills by learning from more experienced developers. I landed a job as a “Software Craftsman”–a fitting title, with a company out of Toronto called Influitive. They had a satellite office in SF and because of my entrepreneurial-ish background I got to work on the Moonshots team, which was like a little startup inside the main company. The five of us conceptualized, designed, and built a new content creation and distribution plaform called [Upshot Stories](https://upshotstories.com){:target="_blank"}. You can check it out the landing page and read some stories but it’ll cost you some serious $$$ to actually see the app. Sadly, our team was ununceremoniously disbanded shortly after launching, but I was hired back on as a contractor to help with maintainence.

For the past few years I’ve been working semi-remotely as a freelance developer in Sonoma County, California, Petaluma, and San Francisco. I’ve been a maintainer, pinch hitter, architect, and project lead. I’ve designed a few things and built many things. I even fix people's email every once in a while(if they buy me a coffee).
